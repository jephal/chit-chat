**The program must be started with at least two processes running. 1. server and 1. client.

To start a server the following command in a terminal must be run:

cd server
go run main.go

To start a client the following command must be run in another terminal windows:

cd client
go run main.go 'clientname'

There service support multiple clients interacting with one server in one chat room.

so startup 4 terminals and you can run server from one, and client from the others
